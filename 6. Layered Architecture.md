Layering is a common practice to separate and organise code units by
their role/responsibilities in the system.

**What it** means **to be layered** {#what-it-means-to-be-layered style="text-align:justify;"}
-----------------------------------

**In a layered system, each layer:**

-   Depends on the layers beneath it;
-   Is independent of the layers on top of it, having no knowledge of
    the layers using it.

In a layered architecture, the layers can be used in a strict way, where
a layer only knows the layer directly beneath it, or in a more flexible
approach where a layer can access any layer beneath it. Both Martin
Fowler and my own experience tells me that the second case seems to work
better in practice as it avoids the creation of proxy methods (or even
complete proxy classes) in the intermediary layers, and can degrade into
the anti-pattern of the Lasagna Architecture (more about it below).

The **advantages** are:

-   We only need to understand the layers beneath the one we are working
    on;
-   Each layer is replaceable by an equivalent implementation, with no
    impact on the other layers;
-   Layers are optimal candidates for standardisation;
-   A layer can be used by several different higher-level layers.

The **disadvantages** are:

-   Layers can not encapsulate everything (a field that is added to the
    UI, most likely also needs to be added to the DB);
-   Extra layers can harm performance, especially if in different tiers.

The 60s and 70s
---------------

Although software development started during the 50s, it was during the
60s and 70s that it was effectively born as we know it today, as the
activity of building applications that can be delivered, deployed and
used by others that are not the developers themselves.

At this point, however, applications were very different than today.
There was no GUI (which only came into existence in the early 90s, maybe
late 80s), all applications were usable only through a CLI, displayed in
a dumb terminal who would just transmit whatever the user typed to the
application which was, most likely, being used from the same computer.

Applications were quite simple so weren't built with layering in mind
and they were deployed and used on one computer making it effectively a
**one-tier** application, although at some point the dumb client might
even have been remote. While these applications were **very simple** ,
they were **not scalable** , for example, if we needed to update the
software to a new version, we would have to do it on every computer that
would have the application installed.

**Layering during the 80s and 90s**
-----------------------------------

During the 1980s, enterprise applications come to life and we start
having several users in a company using desktop computers who access the
application through the network.

At this time, there were mostly three layers:

-   **User Interface (Presentation)** : The user interface, be it a web
    page, a CLI or a native desktop application;
    -   ie: **A native Windows application** as the client (rich
        client), which the common user would use on his desktop
        computer, that would communicate with the server in order to
        actually make things happen. The client would be in charge of
        the application flow and user input validation;
-   **Business logic (Domain)** : The logic that is the reason why the
    application exists;
    -   ie: **An application server** , which would contain the business
        logic and would receive requests from the native client, act on
        them and persist the data to the data storage;
-   **Data source** : The data persistence mechanism (DB), or
    communication with other applications.
    -   ie: **A database server** , which would be used by the
        application server for the persistence of data.

With this shift in usability context, layering started to be a practise,
although it only started to be a common widespread practice during the
1990s (Fowler 2002) with the rise of **client/server** systems. This was
effectively a **two-tier** application, where the client would be a rich
client application used as the application interface, and the server
would have the business logic and the data source.

This architecture pattern solves the **scalability** problem, as several
users could use the application independently, we would just need
another desktop computer, install the client application in it and that
was it. However, if we would have a few hundred, or even just a few
tenth of clients, and we would want to update the application it would
be a **highly** **complex** operation as we would have to update the
clients one by one.

**Layering after the mid 90s** {#layering-after-the-mid-90s style="text-align:justify;"}
------------------------------

Roughly between 1995 and 2005, with the generalised shift to a cloud
context, the increase in application users, application complexity and
infrastructure complexity we end up seeing an evolution of the layering
scheme, where a typical implementation of this layering could be:

-   A **native browser application** , rendering and running the user
    interface, sending requests to the server application;
-   An **application server** , containing the presentation layer, the
    application layer, the domain layer, and the persistence layer;
-   A **database server** , which would be used by the application
    server for the persistence of data.

This is a **three-tier** architecture pattern, also known as **n-tier**
. It is a **scalable** solution and **solves the problem of updating the
clients** as the user interface lives and is compiled on the server,
although it is rendered and ran on the client browser.

**Layering after the early 2000s** {#layering-after-the-early-2000s style="text-align:justify;"}
----------------------------------

In 2003, Eric Evans published his emblematic book [Domain-Driven Design:
Tackling Complexity in the Heart of
Software](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321125215/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=CG11VVP0H8Y8&coliid=I1X0NXLUHTFGE4 "Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software"){#itemName_I1X0NXLUHTFGE4
.a-link-normal .a-declarative} . Among the many key concepts published
in that book, there was also a vision for the layering of a software
system:

-   #### User Interface

    Responsible for drawing the screens the users use to interact with
    the application and translating the user's inputs into application
    commands. It is important to note that the "users" can be human but
    can also be other applications, which corresponds entirely to the
    Boundary objects in the EBI Architecture by Ivar Jacobson (more on
    this in a later post);

-   #### Application Layer

    Orchestrates Domain objects to perform tasks required by the users.
    It does not contain business logic. This relates to the Interactors
    in the EBIArchitecture by Ivar Jacobson, except
    that Jacobson's interactors were any object that was not related to
    the UI nor an Entity;

-   #### Domain Layer

    This is the layer that contains all business logic, the Entities,
    Events and any other object type that contains Business Logic. It
    obviously relates to the Entity object type of EBI. This is the
    heart of the system;

-   #### Infrastructure

    The technical capabilities that support the layers above, ie.
    persistence or messaging.

**Anti-pattern: Lasagna Architecture** {#anti-pattern-lasagna-architecture style="text-align:justify;"}
--------------------------------------

![lasagna](https://herbertograca.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/lasagna.png?w=1100){.size-full
.wp-image-8661 .aligncenter sizes="(max-width: 355px) 100vw, 355px"
srcset="https://herbertograca.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/lasagna.png 355w, https://herbertograca.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/lasagna.png?w=150 150w, https://herbertograca.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/lasagna.png?w=300 300w"}

*Lasagna Architecture* is the name commonly used to refer to the
**anti-pattern for Layered Architecture** . It happens when:

-   We decide to use a **strict layering approach** , where a layer only
    knows about the layer immediately below it. In such case, **we will
    end up creating proxy methods, and even proxy classes** , just so we
    go through the intermediate layers instead of directly using the
    layer we need;
-   We lead the project into **over-abstraction** in an urge to create
    the perfect system;
-   Small **updates reverberate through all areas of an application** ,
    for example, tidying up a single layer can be a large undertaking
    with huge risks and small payoff.
-   We end up with **too many layers** , which increases the complexity
    of the overall system;
-   We end up with **too many tiers** , which both increases the
    complexity and damages the performance of the overall system;
-   We explicitly **organise our monolith according to its layers** (ie.
    UI, Domain, DB), instead of organising it by its
    sub-domains/components (ie. Product, Payment, Checkout), destroying
    modularity and encapsulation of the domain concepts.

**Conclusion**
--------------

Layered Architecture is one more way to provide for separation of
concerns, encapsulation and decoupling, by grouping code units by their
functional role within the application.

However, as most things in life, too much is counter productive! So the
rule-of-thumb is: **Use just the layers we need, the tiers we need,**
and nothing more! We must not get carried away chasing an architectural
holy grail, which does not exist. What does exist is a need, and the
best possible fit for that need. Which is part of **Lean** , btw.

Furthermore, it's important to note that this top/down approach to
layering is outdated. It is no longer what we should do in modern
software development, there are new and better ways of thinking of an
application layer. I will talk about then in following posts.
