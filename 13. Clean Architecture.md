*This post is part of [ [The Software Architecture
Chronicles](https://herbertograca.com/2017/07/03/the-software-architecture-chronicles/)
]{style="color:#ff0000;"} , a [series of posts about Software
Architecture](https://herbertograca.com/category/development/series/software-architecture/)
. In them, I write about what I've learned on Software Architecture, how
I think of it, and how I use that knowledge. The contents of this post
might make more sense if you read the previous posts in this series.*

Robert C. Martin (AKA Uncle Bob) published his ideas about *Clean
Architecture* back in 2012, in a [post on his
blog](https://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)
, and lectured about it at a few conferences.

The Clean Architecture leverages well-known and not so
well-known concepts, rules, and patterns, explaining how to fit them
together, to propose a standardised way of building applications.

**Standing on the shoulders of EBI, Hexagonal and Onion Architectures** {#standing-on-the-shoulders-of-ebi-hexagonal-and-onion-architectures style="text-align:justify;"}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The core objectives behind Clean Architecture are the same as for Ports
& Adapters (Hexagonal) and Onion Architectures:

-   Independence of tools;
-   Independence of delivery mechanisms;
-   Testability in isolation.

In the post about Clean Architecture was published, this was the diagram
used to explain the global idea:

As Uncle Bob himself says in his post, the diagram above is an attempt
at integrating the most recent architecture ideas *into a single
actionable idea* .

Let's compare the Clean Architecture diagram with the diagrams used to
explain Hexagonal Architecture and Onion Architecture, and see where
they coincide:

-   #### Externalisation of tools and delivery mechanisms

    Hexagonal Architecture focuses on externalising the tools and the
    delivery mechanisms from the application, using interfaces (ports)
    and adapters. This is also one of the core fundaments of Onion
    Architecture, as we can see by its diagram, the UI, the
    infrastructure and the tests are all in the outermost layer of the
    diagram. The Clean Architecture has exactly the same characteristic,
    having the UI, the web, the DB, etc, in the outermost layer. In the
    end, all application core code is framework/library independent.

-   #### Dependencies direction

    In the Hexagonal Architecture, we don't have anything explicitly
    telling us the direction of the dependencies. Nevertheless, we can
    easily infer it: The Application has a port (an interface) which
    must be implemented or used by an adapter. So the Adapter depends on
    the interface, it depends on the application which is in the centre.
    What is outside depends on what is inside, the direction of the
    dependencies is towards the centre. In the Onion Architecture
    diagram, we also don't have anything explicitly telling us the
    dependencies direction, however, in his second post, Jeffrey Palermo
    states very clearly that *all dependencies are toward the centre* .
    The Clean Architecture diagram, in turn, it's quite explicit in
    pointing out that the dependencies direction is towards the centre.
    They all introduce the Dependency Inversion Principle at the
    architectural level. *Nothing in an inner circle can know anything
    at all about something in an outer circle.* Furthermore, *when we
    pass data across a boundary, it is always in the form that is most
    convenient for the inner circle.*

-   #### Layers

    The Hexagonal Architecture diagram only shows us two layers: Inside
    of the application and outside of the application. The Onion
    Architecture, on the other hand, brings to the mix the application
    layers identified by DDD: Application Services holding the use case
    logic; Domain Services encapsulating domain logic that does not
    belong in Entities nor Value Objects; and the Entities, Value
    Objects, etc.. When compared to the Onion Architecture, the Clean
    Architecture maintains the Application Services layer (Use Cases)
    and the Entities layer but it seems to forget about the Domain
    Services layer. However, reading Uncle Bob post we realise that he
    considers an Entity not only as and Entity in the DDD sense but as
    any Domain object: " *An entity can be an object with methods, or it
    can be a set of data structures and functions.* ". In reality, he
    merged those 2 innermost layers to simplify the diagram.

-   #### Testability in isolation

    In all three Architecture styles the rules they abide by provide
    them with insulation of the application and domain logic. This means
    that in all cases we can simply mock the external tools and delivery
    mechanisms and test the application code in insulation, without
    using any DB nor HTTP requests.

As we can see, Clean Architecture incorporates the rules of Hexagonal
Architecture and Onion Architecture. So far, the Clean Architecture does
not add anything new to the equation. However, in the bottom right
corner of the Clean Architecture diagram, we can see a small extra
diagram...

**Standing on the shoulders of MVC and EBI** {#standing-on-the-shoulders-of-mvc-and-ebi style="text-align:justify;"}
--------------------------------------------

The small extra diagram in the bottom right corner of the Clean
Architecture diagram explains how the flow of control works. That small
diagram does not give us much information, but the blog post
explanations and the conference lectures given by Robert C. Martin
expand on the subject.

![cleanarchitecturedesign](https://herbertograca.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/cleanarchitecturedesign.png?w=1100){.alignnone
.size-full .wp-image-11316 sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px"
srcset="https://herbertograca.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/cleanarchitecturedesign.png 847w, https://herbertograca.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/cleanarchitecturedesign.png?w=150 150w, https://herbertograca.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/cleanarchitecturedesign.png?w=300 300w, https://herbertograca.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/cleanarchitecturedesign.png?w=768 768w"}

In the diagram above, on the left side, we have the View and the
Controller of MVC. Everything inside/between the black double lines
represents the Model in MVC. That Model also represents the EBI
Architecture (we can clearly see the Boundaries, the Interactor and the
Entities), the "Application" in Hexagonal Architecture, the "Application
Core" in the Onion Architecture, and the "Entities" and "Use Cases"
layers in the Clean Architecture diagram above.

Following the control flow, we have an HTTP Request that reaches the
Controller. The controller will then:

1.  Dismantle the Request;
2.  Create a Request Model with the relevant data;
3.  Execute a method in the Interactor (which was injected into the
    Controller using the Interactor's interface, the Boundary), passing
    it the Request Model;
4.  The Interactor:
    1.  Uses the Entity Gateway Implementation (which was injected into
        the Interactor using the Entity Gateway Interface) to find the
        relevant Entities;
    2.  Orchestrates interactions between Entities;
    3.  Creates a Response Model with the data result of the Operation;
    4.  Populates the Presenter giving it the Response Model;
    5.  Returns the Presenter to the Controller;
5.  Uses the Presenter to generate a ViewModel;
6.  Binds the ViewModel to the View;
7.  Returns the View to the client.

The only thing here where I feel some friction and do differently in my
projects is the usage of the " *Presenter* ". I rather have the
Interactor return the data in some kind of DTO, as opposed to injecting
an object that gets populated with data.

What I usually do is the actual MVP implementation, where the Controller
has the responsibility of receiving and responding to the client.

**Conclusion** {#conclusion style="text-align:justify;"}
--------------

I would not say that the Clean Architecture is revolutionary because it
does not actually bring a new groundbreaking concept or pattern to the
table.

However, I would say that it is a work of the utmost importance:

-   It recovers somewhat forgotten concepts, rules, and patterns;
-   It clarifies useful and important concepts, rules and patterns;
-   It tells us how all these concepts, rules and patterns fit together
    to provide us with a standardised way to build complex applications
    with maintainability in mind.

When I think about Uncle Bob work with the Clean Architecture, It makes
me think of Isaac Newton. Gravity had always been there, everybody knew
that if we release an apple one meter above the ground, it will move
towards the ground. The "only" thing Newton did was to publish a paper
making that fact explicit\*. It was a "simple" thing to do, but it
allowed people to reason about it and use that concrete idea as a
foundation to other ideas.

In other words, I see Robert C. Martin is the Isaac Newton of software
development! 🙂
