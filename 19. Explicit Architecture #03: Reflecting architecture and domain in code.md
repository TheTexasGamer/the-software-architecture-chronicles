*This post is part of [The Software Architecture
Chronicles](https://herbertograca.com/2017/07/03/the-software-architecture-chronicles/)
, a [series of posts about Software
Architecture](https://herbertograca.com/category/development/series/software-architecture/)
. In them, I write about what I've learned on Software Architecture, how
I think of it, and how I use that knowledge. The contents of this post
might make more sense if you read the previous posts in this series.*

When creating an application, the easy part is to build something that
works. To build something that has performance despite handling a
massive load of data, that is a bit more difficult. But the greatest
challenge is to build an application that is actually maintainable for
many years (10, 20, 100 years).

Most companies where I worked have a history of rebuilding their
applications every 3 to 5 years, some even 2 years. This has extremely
high costs, it has a major impact on how successful the application is,
and therefore how successful the company is, besides being extremely
frustrating for developers to work with a messy code base, and making
them want to leave the company. A serious company, with a long-term
vision, cannot afford any of it, not the financial loss, not the time
loss, not the reputation loss, not the client loss, not the talent loss.

Reflecting the architecture and domain in the codebase is fundamental to
the maintainability of an application, and therefore crucial in
preventing all those nasty problems.

**Explicit Architecture** is how I rationalise a set of principles and
practices advocated by developers far more experienced than me and how I
organise a code base to make it reflect and communicate the architecture
and domain of the project.

In my [previous
post](https://herbertograca.com/2017/11/16/explicit-architecture-01-ddd-hexagonal-onion-clean-cqrs-how-i-put-it-all-together/)
, I talked about how I put all those ideas together and presented some
infographics and *UMLish* diagrams to try to create some kind of a
concept map of how I think of it.

However, how do we actually put it to practice in our codebase?!

In this post, I will talk about how I reflect the architecture and the
domain of a project in the code and will propose a generic structure
that I think that can help us plan for maintainability.

My two mental maps
------------------

In the last two posts of this series I explained the two mental maps I
use to help me think about code and organise a codebase, at least in my
head.

The first one is composed by a series of concentric layers, which in the
end are sliced to make up the domain wise modules of the application,
the components. In this diagram, the dependency direction goes inwards,
meaning that outer layers know about inner layers, but not the other way
around.

:::

The second one is a set of horizontal layers, where the previous diagram
sits on top, followed by the code shared by the components (shared
kernel), followed by our own extensions to the languages, and finally
the actual programming languages in the bottom. Here, the dependencies
direction goes downwards.

Architecturally evident coding style
------------------------------------

Using an architectureally evident coding style means that our coding
style (coding standards, class, methods and variables naming
conventions, code structure, ...) somehow comunicates the domain and the
architecture to who is reading the code. There are two main ideas on how
to achieve an architecturally evident coding style.

> Fairbanks](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/asset_files/Presentation/2013_017_001_48651.pdf)*

The first one is about using the code artefacts (classes, variables,
modules, ...) names to convey both domain and architectural meaning. So,
if we have a class that is a repository dealing with invoice entities,
we should name it something like \`InvoiceRepository\`, which will tell
us that it deals with the Invoice domain concept and its architectural
role is that of a repository. This helps us know and understand where it
should be located, plus how and when to use it. Nevertheless, I think we
don't need to do do it with every code artefact in our codebase, for
example I feel that post-fixing an entity with 'Entity' is redundant and
just adds noise.

The second one is about making sub-domains explicit as top level
artefacts of our codebase, as domain wise modules, as components.

So, the first one should be clear and I don't think it requires any
further explanation. However, the second one is more tricky, so lets
dive into that.

Making architecture explicit
----------------------------

We've seen, in my first diagram, that at the highest zoom level we have
3 different types of code:

-   **The user interface** , containing the code adapting a delivery
    mechanism to a use case;
-   **The application core** , containing the use cases and the domain
    logic;
-   **The infrastructure** , containing the code that adapts the
    tools/libraries to the application core needs.

![](https://herbertograca.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/folder_structure_01.png){.wp-image-16972}

So at the root of our source folder we can reflect these types of code
by creating 3 folders, one for each type of code. These three folders
will represent three namespaces and later on we can even create a test
to assert that both the user interface and the infrastructure know about
the core, but not the other way around, in other words, we can test that
the dependencies direction goes inwards.

### The user interface

Within a web enterprise application, it is common to have several APIs,
for example a REST API for clients, another one for web-hooks used by
3rd party applications, maybe a legacy SOAP API that still needs to be
maintained, or maybe a GraphQL API for a new mobile app...

It is also common for such applications to have several CLI commands
used by Cron jobs or on demand maintenance operations.

And of course, it will have the website itself, used by regular users,
but maybe also another website used by the administrators of the
application.

These are all different views on the same application, they are all
different user interfaces of the application.

So our application can actually have several user interfaces, even if
some of them are used only by non-human users (other 3rd party
applications). Let's reflect that by means of folders/namespaces to
separate and isolate the several user interfaces.

We have mainly 3 types of user interfaces, APIs, CLI and websites. So
lets start by making that difference explicit inside the *UserInterface*
root namespace by creating one folder for each of them.

![](https://herbertograca.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/folder_structure_02.png){.wp-image-16973}

Next, we go deeper and inside the namespace for each type and, if
needed, we create a namespace for each UI (maybe for the CLI we don't
need to do it).

### The infrastructure

In a similar way as in the User Interface, our application uses several
tools (libraries and 3rd party applications), for example an ORM, a
message queue, or an SMS provider.

Furthermore, for each of these tools we might need to have several
implementations. For example, consider the case where a company expands
to another country and for pricing reasons its better to use a different
SMS provider in each country: we will need different adapter
implementations using the same port so they can be used interchangeably.
Another case is when we are refactoring the database schema, or even
switching the DB engine, and need (or decide) to also switch to another
ORM: then we will have 2 ORM adapters hooked into our application.

![](https://herbertograca.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/folder_structure_03.png){.wp-image-16974}

So within the Infrastructure namespace we start by creating a namespace
for each tool type (ORM, MessageQueue, SmsClient), and inside each of
those we create a namespace for each of the adapters of the vendors we
use (Doctrine, Propel, MessageBird, Twilio, ...).

### The Core

Within the Core, at the highest level of zoom, we have three types of
code, the **Components** , the **Shared Kernel** and the **Ports** . So,
we create folders/namespaces for all of them.

#### Components

In the Components namespace we create a namespace for each component,
and inside each of those we create a namespace for the Application layer
and a namespace for the Domain layer. Inside the Application and Domain
namespaces we start by just dumping all classes on there and as the
number of classes grow, we start grouping them as needed (I find it
overzealous to create a folder to put just one class in it, so I rather
do it as the need for it arises).

![](https://herbertograca.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/folder_structure_041.png){.wp-image-16981}

At this point we need to decide if we should group them by subject
(invoice, transaction, ...) or by technical role (repository, service,
value object, ...), but I feel that, whatever the choice, it doesn't
really have much impact because we are at the leafs of the organisation
tree so, if needed, its easy to do changes to that last bit of structure
without much impact to the rest of the codebase.

#### Ports

The Ports namespace will contain a namespace for each tool the Core
uses, just like we did for the Infrastructure, where we will place the
code that the core will use in order to use the underlying tool.

![](https://herbertograca.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/folder_structure_042.png){.wp-image-16982}

This code will also be used by the adapters, whose role is to translate
between the port and the actual tool. It its simplest form, a port is
just an Interface but in many cases it also needs value objects, DTOs,
services, builders, query objects or even repositories.

#### Shared Kernel

In the Shared Kernel we will place the code that is shared among
Components. After experimenting with different inner structures for the
Shared Kernel, I can't decide on a structure that will fit all
scenarios. I feel that for some code it makes sense to separate it per
component as we did in `     Core\Component    ` (ie. Entity IDs clearly
belong to one component) but other cases not so much (ie. Events might
be triggered and listened to by several components, so they belong to
none). Maybe a mix is the better fit.

![](https://herbertograca.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/folder_structure_04.png){.wp-image-16975}

### Userland language extensions

Last, but not least, we have our own extensions to the language. As
explained in the previous post on this series, this is code that could
be part of the language but, for some reason, it's not. In the case of
PHP we can think, for example, of a DateTime class based on the one
provided by PHP but with some extra methods. Another example could be a
UUID class, which although not provided by PHP, it is by nature very
aseptic, domain agnostic, and therefore could be used by any project
independently of the Domain.

![](https://herbertograca.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/folder_structure_05.png){.wp-image-16976}

This code is used as if it would be provided by the language itself, so
it needs to be fully under our control. This doesn't mean, however, that
we can't use 3rd party libraries. We can, and should use them when it
makes sense, but they must be wrapped by our own implementation (so that
we can easily switch the underlying 3rd party library) which is the code
that will be used directly on the application codebase. Eventually, it
can be a project on its own, in its own CVS repository, and used in
several projects.

Enforcing the architecture
--------------------------

All these ideas and the way we decide to put them to practise, are a lot
to take in, and they are not easy to master. Even if we do master all
this, in the end we are only humans, so we will make mistakes and our
colleagues will make mistakes, it's just the way it goes.

Just like we make mistakes in code and have a test suite to prevent
those mistakes from reaching production, we must do the same with the
codebase structure.

To do this, in the PHP world we have a little tool called
[Deptrac](https://github.com/sensiolabs-de/deptrac) (but I bet similar
tools exist for other languages as well), created by Sensiolabs. We
configure it using a yaml file, where we define the layers we have and
the allowed dependencies between them. Then we run it through the
command line, which means we can easily run it in a CI, just like we run
a test suite in the CI.

We can even have it create a diagram of the dependencies, which will
visually show us the dependencies, including the ones breaking the
configured rule set:

Conclusion
----------

An application is composed of a domain and a technical structure, the
architecture. Those are the real differentials in an application, not
the used tools, libraries, or delivery mechanisms. If we want an
application to be maintainable for a long time, both of these need to be
explicit in the codebase, so that developers can know about it,
understand it, comply to it and further evolve it as needed.

This explicitness will help us understand the boundaries as we code,
which will in turn help us keep the application design modular, with
high cohesion and low coupling.

Again, most of these ideas and practices I have been talking about in my
previous posts, come from developers far better and more experienced
than me. I have discussed them at length with plenty of my colleagues in
different companies, I have experimented with them in codebases of
enterprise applications, and they have been working very well for the
projects I've been involved with.

Nevertheless, I believe there are no *silver bullets* , no *one boot
fits all* , no *Holy Grail* .

These ideas and the structure I refer in this post should be seen as a
generic template that can be used in most enterprise applications, but
if necessary it should be adapted with no regrets. We always need to
evaluate the context (the project, the team, the business, ...) and do
the best we can, but I believe and hope that this template is a good
starting point or, at the very least, food for thought.

If you want to see this implemented in a demo project, I have forked and
refactored the Symfony Demo application into using these ideas. You can
check how I did it
