# MVC and its alternatives

Creating maintainable applications has always been the real long-term
challenge of building applications.

Not long ago, I worked for a company whose core business application was
a SaaS platform, used by a few thousands of client companies. That
crucial application was three years old and had code files with HTML,
CSS, business logic and SQL mixed up. Of course, two years after being
released, the company decided to rebuild it from scratch. Although these
situations still happen, today many of us know these practices are wrong
and know how to avoid them.

However, back in the 1970s, mixing responsibilities was the common
practice and people were still trying to discover how to do it better.
As application complexity grew, making changes to the UI would
inevitably imply changes to the business logic as well, increasing the
complexity of the changes, the time spent to do those changes and the
likelihood of bugs (because there would be more code changed).

MCV came into play to solve those problems, by promoting "separation of
concerns" between front-end and back-end.

## **1979 -- Model-View-Controller**

![MVC](https://herbertograca.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/mvc.jpg?w=235&h=289)

With the intention of solving the issues explained above, [in 1979
Trygve Reenskaug came up with the MVC
pattern](http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~trygver/1979/mvc-2/1979-12-MVC.pdf) as
a way to separate concerns, isolating the UI from the business logic.
The pattern was used in the context of desktop [GUIs, which existed
since
1973](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_graphical_user_interface#Xerox_PARC).

The MVC pattern separates the code in three conceptual units:

- The Model represents the business logic;
- The View represents a widget in the UI: a button, text box, etc.;
- The Controller provides for coordination between the view and the
  model. This means it:
  - Decides what views to show, and with what data;
  - Translates user actions (ie. click of a button) into business
    logic.

> A model could be a single object (rather uninteresting), or it could
> be some structure of objects.
>
> Trygve Reenskaug 1979,
> [MVC](http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~trygver/1979/mvc-2/1979-12-MVC.pdf)

Other important concepts to know about the original MVC pattern is that:

1.  The view uses the Model data objects directly, to show their data;
2.  When the model data changes, it triggers an event that immediately
    updates the View (remember, in 1979 there was no HTTP);
3.  Each view is, typically, associated to one controller;
4.  Each screen can contain several pairs of view & controller;
5.  There could be multiple views for each controller.

Today's HTTP Request & Response paradigm, that I'm familiar with, does
not use this original MVC flavor because, in this case, the flow goes
from the View to the Controller, like what I am familiar with, but then
in the other direction it flows directly from the model to the view
without passing through the Controller.

Furthermore, in the current Request & Response paradigm, when data
changes in the DB it does not trigger an update in a View being shown in
a browser (although this could be implemented using web sockets). To see
the updated data, the user needs to do a new request and the updated
data would always return through the controller.

## **1987/2000 -- PAC / Hierarchical Model-View-Controller**

![HMVC](https://herbertograca.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/hmvc.png?w=243&h=225)

PAC, aka HMVC, provides for increased modularity in contexts of
**_widgetization_** of sections of the UI.

For example, when we have a View with a section that is used in the
exact same format throughout several other Views or even simply repeated
in the same view. A practical example is a section of a web page with
the contents of an RSS feed, which is reused in other pages.

Using HMVC, the controller that handles the main request will forward
sub-requests to other controllers in order to get the renderization of
the widgets and then incorporate it in the renderization of the main
view.

Personally, I have encountered the need for this a few times in a
context of HTTP Request/Response paradigm, but I find it a much simpler
approach to have the UI make an AJAX call to the controller that can
render the widget. This keeps the benefits of modularization without the
added complexity of having nested controller calls, and the plus side
that these sub-requests can be cached in something like Varnish.

## 1996 **-- Model-View-Presenter**

![MVP](https://herbertograca.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/mvp.jpg?w=220&h=269)

The MCV pattern provided a great improvement in the programming paradigm
of its time. However, as applications complexity grew, so it grew the
need for further decoupling.

In 1996, the IBM subsidiary Taligent made public their MVP pattern,
based on MVC. The idea was to further isolate the Model from the UI
concerns:

- The View is passive and unaware of model;
- Focus on thin controllers (presenters) that contain no business
  logic and simply invokes commands and/or queries in the model,
  passing raw data to the View;
- A change in data does not trigger an update in a view directly: it
  always goes through the presenter, which in turn updates the View.
  This allows for the controller (presenter) to perform extra
  presentation-related logic before updating the view. For example,
  also update data related to the data that changed in the DB;
- There is a single presenter for each view.

This is closer what I am used to seeing in today's Request/Response
paradigm: the **flow always goes through the Controller/Presenter**.
Nevertheless, the Presenter still does not actively update the view, it
always needs a new request to be performed for the changes to be
visible.

In MVP, the Presenter is also known as a [Supervisor
Controller](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/SupervisingPresenter.html).

## **2005 -- Model-View-ViewModel**

![MVVM](https://herbertograca.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/mvvm.jpg?w=211&h=258)

Again, derived from applications increased complexity, in 2005 the
[MVVM pattern was announced by John Gossman](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/johngossman/2005/10/08/introduction-to-modelviewviewmodel-pattern-for-building-wpf-apps/),
one of Microsoft's WPF and Silverlight architects, with the goal to
further segregate the UI design from the code and provide data binding
from the View to the data model.

The Controller is "replaced" by the ViewModel:

> pattern](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/johngossman/2005/10/08/introduction-to-modelviewviewmodel-pattern-for-building-wpf-apps/)

The ideas behind MVVM were:

- One ViewModel corresponds to only one View and vice-versa;
- Move view logic to the ViewModel to simplify the view;
- One on one mapping between the data used in the view and the data in
  the ViewModel;
- Binding of the data in the ViewModel to the data in the View, so
  that when data is changed in the ViewModel it immediately reflects
  in the View.

Just like in the case of the original MVC pattern, this approach is not
possible in a traditional Request/Response paradigm because the
ViewModel can not actively update the View (unless using web sockets)
and MVVM requires it. Also, the fact that the ViewModel has properties
matching the data used in the View is not what is common practice in a
Controller, in my experience.

## **Model-View-Presenter-ViewModel**

![M-V-P-VM](https://herbertograca.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/m-v-p-vm1.png?w=358&h=485)

When building complex Enterprise Applications for the Cloud, I prefer to
rationalise the application UI structure as M-V-P-VM where the ViewModel
is what Martin Fowler called a [Presentation
Model](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PresentationModel.html),\sback in 2004.

- #### Model

  A set of classes that contain all the business logic and use cases;

- #### View

  A template, with which to generate the HTML using a template engine;

- #### ViewModel (aka [Presentation Model](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PresentationModel.html) )

  Receives raw data from a query (or Model entities from which to
  extract raw data), and holds that data to be used in the template.
  It also encapsulates complex presentation logic, in order to
  simplify the template. I find that the usage of the ViewModel is
  especially important because we will not be tempted to use entities
  in the template, which allows us to completely isolate the view from
  the Model:

  - Changes in the Model (ie. changes in entities structure) might
    bubble up and impact the ViewModel, but not the template;
  - Complex presentation logic will not leak into the domain (ie.
    creating methods in business entities that are exclusively
    related to presentation logic) because we can encapsulate it in
    the ViewModel;
  - The dependencies of the template become explicit because they
    must be set in the ViewModel. Making those dependencies visible
    can help us, for example, to decide what should be eagerly
    loaded from the DB to prevent N+1 problems.

- #### Presenter

  Receives an HTTP request, triggers a command or a query, uses the
  data returned by the query, a ViewModel, a Template and a template
  engine to generate the HTML and send it back to the client. All
  Views interaction goes through a Presenter.

Here's a simple (and naive) code example of how I do it:

```php
<?php
// src/UI/Admin/Some/Controller/Namespace/Detail/DetailsViewModel.php

namespace UI\Admin\Some\Controller\Namespace\Detail;

// use ...

final class DetailsViewModel implements TemplateViewModelInterface
{
    /**
     * @var array
     */
    private $mainEntity = [];

    /**
     * @var array
     */
    private $relatedEntityList = [];

    /**
     * @var bool
     */
    private $shouldDisplayFancyDialog = false;

    /**
     * @var bool
     */
    private $canEditData = false;

    /**
     * @param SomeEntity $mainEntity
     * @param RelatedEntity[] $relatedEntityList
     */
    public function __construct(SomeEntity $mainEntity, array $relatedEntityList)
    {
        $this->mainEntity = [
            'name' => $mainEntity->getName(),
            'description' => $mainEntity->getResume(),
        ];

        foreach ($relatedEntityList as $relatedEntity) {
            $this->relatedEntityList[] = [
                'title' => $relatedEntity->getTitle(),
                'subtitle' => $relatedEntity->getSubtitle(),
            ];
        }

        $this->shouldDisplayFancyDialog = /* ... some complex conditional using the entities data ... */ ;

        $this->canEditData = /* ... another complex conditional using the entities data ... */ ;
    }

    public function getMainEntity(): array
    {
        return $this->mainEntity;
    }

    public function getRelatedEntityList(): array
    {
        return $this->relatedEntityList;
    }

    public function shouldDisplayFancyDialog(): bool
    {
        return $this->shouldDisplayFancyDialog;
    }

    public function canEditData(): bool
    {
        return $this->canEditData;
    }
}
```

The template and the ViewModel have a one-on-one match, which means that
a View can only be used with a specific ViewModel and vice-versa. This
actually even makes me think that maybe **we could encapsulate the
template and the ViewModel inside a View object, effectively decoupling
the Controller from the template and the ViewModel**,\smaking it depend
on a generic View Interface, but I never experimented with this.

## **Conclusion**

We might find other variants of MVC on the web. However, these are the
ones I find more interesting and/or relevant for my work.

Nevertheless, the patterns I referenced here were created for a context
of desktop applications and/or rich clients and therefore they don't
always fit 100% to the Request/Response paradigm.

If you are doing Enterprise Cloud Applications and you are using MVC,
most likely you are actually using something closer to MVP, but in any
case, my point is not about following a specific variant of MVC or know
all the names and being annoyingly strict with it, my point is that we
should **learn from all of them, so we can use and adapt as we need**.
The end goal is, as usual, **low coupling** and **high cohesion** :
**separation of concerns**.
