Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) 
===================================

The SOA Style has been around since the late 1980s and has its origins
in ideas introduced by CORBA, DCOM, DCE and others. Much has been said
about SOA, and there are a few different implementation patterns but, in
essence, SOA focuses on only a few concepts and doesn't give any
prescription on how to implement them:

-   Composability of user-facing applications;
-   Reusable Business Services;
-   Technology stack independent;
-   Autonomy (independent evolution, scalability & deployability).

SOA is a set of architectural principles independent of any technology
or product, just like polymorphism and encapsulation are.

In this post I am going to address the following patterns related to
SOA:

-   [CORBA -- Common Object Request Broker Architecture](#01)
-   [Web Services](#02)
-   [Message Queue](#3)
-   [Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)](#04)
-   [Microservices](#05)

**CORBA -- Common Object Request Broker Architecture**

During the 1980s, derived from the growing usage of enterprise networks
and the client/server architecture, there was an increasing need for a
common way of getting applications that were built using different
technologies and were running on different computers with a different
OS, to communicate. CORBA was developed to fulfil those needs. It is a
standard, for Distributed Computing, that developed during the 1980s and
reached its first mature version 1991.

The CORBA standard was implemented by several vendors and aimed at
providing:

-   Platform neutral Remote Procedure Call;
-   Transactions (also remote transactions!!);
-   Security;
-   Events;
-   Programming language independence;
-   OS independence;
-   Hardware independence;
-   Isolation from data-transfer/communication details;
-   Data typing through an Interface Definition Language (IDL).

At the moment CORBA is still used for heterogeneous computing, for
example, [it is still part of JAVA
EE](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/idl/corba.html)
, although [it will be packaged as a separate module from JAVA 9
onwards](https://www.infoq.com/news/2016/06/corba-removed-java-9) .

It's important to note, though, that **I don't consider CORBA to be an
SOA pattern** (although I do consider both CORBA and SOA patterns to be
under the umbrella of distributed computing). I chose to include it here
because I feel it was **its shortcomings that led to the SOA** movement.

### How it works 

First, we need to acquire an Object Request Broker (ORB), which conforms
to the CORBA specification, it is supplied by a vendor and it uses
language mappers to generate stubs and skeletons in the client code
languages. Using that ORB and the interface definitions defined using an
IDL (similar to a WSDL), in the client, we generate **stub** classes of
the real classes that can be called remotely and, in the server, we
generate **skeleton** classes that can handle incoming requests and make
the call to the real target object.

![1980s -
CORBA](https://herbertograca.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/1980s-corba.png?w=1100)

1.  The caller calls a local procedure implemented by the stub;
2.  The stub validates the call and creates a request message that
    passes to the ORB;
3.  The client ORB sends the message over the network to the server and
    blocks the current execution thread;
4.  The server ORB receives the request message and instantiates the
    skeleton;
5.  The skeleton executes the procedure on the called object;
6.  The called object performs a computation and returns the result;
7.  The skeleton packs the output arguments into a response message and
    passes it to the ORB;
8.  The ORB sends the message over the network back to the client;
9.  The client ORB receives the response message, unpacks it and
    delivers it to the stub;
10. The stub passes output arguments to the caller, releases execution
    thread and the caller continues in execution.

### Pros 

-   Tech stack independence (except for the ORB implementation);
-   Isolation from data-transfer/communication details.

### Cons 

-   **Location transparency:** The client code does not know if a call
    is local or remote. This sounds like a good thing, however, the
    latency and type of failures are quite different, depending if it's
    a local or remote call. Not knowing what type of call it is, makes
    it impossible for applications to choose an appropriate strategy to
    handle the method call, and to end up making remote calls inside a
    loop, and therefore considerably slowing down the whole system.
-   **Complex, redundant and ambiguous specification:** It was created
    as a mash-up of several existing vendor versions, so (at that time)
    it was ambiguous and redundant, making it difficult to implement.
-   **Blocked communication pipes:** It used specific protocols over
    TCP/IP and specific ports, or even random ports. But enterprise
    security rules and firewalls would often only allow for HTTP
    communication over port 80, effectively blocking CORBA
    communication.

**Web Services** 
----------------

Although CORBA still has its use cases nowadays, we learned that **we
needed to reduce the remote communications** to make the system more
performant, **we needed a reliable communication pipe** , and **we
needed a simpler communication specification** .

Thus, during the late 1990s, web services started to spawn with the
goals of solving the problems mentioned above:

-   #### We needed a **[ reliable communication pipe ], so** :

    -   **HTTP through port 80** is the default communication pipe;
    -   An **agnostic communication language** is used (like **XML** or
        **JSON** );

-   #### We needed to **[ reduce the remote communications ], so** :

    -   We have **explicit remote communications** so that we know
        exactly when we are making a remote call;
    -   We have **coarse-grained remote calls** , ie. instead of calling
        remote objects often, we call a remote service less often;

-   #### We needed a **[ simpler communication specification ], so** :

    -   **SOAP** had its first draft in 1998 and reached a W3C
        recommendation in 2003, making it effectively a standard. It
        embodied some of the ideas of CORBA, like a layer to handle the
        communication and a "document" defining the interfaces using a
        *Web Services Description Language* (WSDL);
    -   **REST** was defined in 2000, by Roy Fielding in his PhD
        dissertation " *Architectural Styles and the Design of
        Network-based Software Architectures* ", and it is a much
        simpler specification than SOAP which made it quickly gain
        higher adoption than the slightly older SOAP specification.
    -   **GraphQL** was developed by Facebook in 2012 and released to
        the public in 2015. It is an API query language that allows the
        client to specify exactly what data the server should send back,
        as opposed to an ad-hoc payload, avoiding both over-fetching and
        under-fetching data.

![2000s -
SOA](https://herbertograca.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/2000s-soa.png?w=1100)

Through Web services, SOA makes a paradigm shift from one of remotely
invoking methods on objects (CORBA), to one of passing messages between
services.

We need to understand, though, that under the umbrella of SOA, a web
service is not just a general purpose API, which simply provides CRUD
access to its database through HTTP. While that implementation might be
useful in some cases, *it requires that users understand the underlying
model and comply with the business rules to ensure that your data
integrity is protected* . SOA implies that web services are designed as
bounded contexts for business sub-domains, abstracting the
implementation from the conceptual service they provide.

> SOA is not just an architecture of services seen from a technology
> perspective, but the policies, practices, and frameworks by which we
> ensure the right services are provided and consumed.

> Microsoft 2004, [Understanding Service-Oriented

### Pros 

-   Independent tech stack, deployment and scalability of services;
-   **Common, simple and reliable communication channel (text through
    HTTP, port 80);**
-   **Optimised communication;**
-   **Stable communication specification;**
-   **Insulation of Domain contexts.**

### Cons 

-   **Difficult integration** of different web services, due to
    different communication languages, ie. two web services that use
    different JSON representations of the same concept;
-   Synchronous communication can **overload** the systems.

**Message Queue** 
-----------------

The core idea is to have several applications communicating
asynchronously between them, using agnostic messages. The Message Queue
provides for improved scalability and higher decoupling between the
applications as they don't need to know where the other applications are
located, how many and not even who they are. Despite this, they all need
to use the same communication language, ie a predetermined text format
to represent data.

A Message Queue uses a message broker software (ie. RabbitMQ,
Beanstalkd, Kafka, ...) as an infrastructure artefact and can be set up
in different ways to implement the communication between applications:

-   **Request/Reply**
    -   A client sends a message to the Message Queue, including a "
        *conversation* " reference. The message is delivered to a
        specific node, which will reply with another message, to the
        original sender, containing the same *conversation* reference so
        that the receiver knows to what *conversation* the message
        refers to and it can continue the process. It's very useful for
        medium and long-running business processes ( ***sagas*** ).
-   **Publish/Subscribe**
    -   **List-Based**\
        It maintains lists of published topics and subscribers to those
        topics. As it receives messages for a topic it puts the message
        into the corresponding topic list. Matching the message to a
        topic can be done by the message type or with a more complex
        set of predetermined criteria that can include the message
        content itself.
    -   **Broadcast-Based**\
        As it receives messages, it broadcasts them to all the nodes
        that are listening to the queue. Each listening node is
        responsible for filtering and processing only the messages that
        it is interested in.

![1995s - Message
Queue](https://herbertograca.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/1995s-message-queue.jpg?w=1100)

All these patterns can be set up in a ***pull*** (aka *polling)* or
***push*** approach *:*

-   In a **pull scenario** , the client will ask the queue for a message
    at every *X* amount of time. This has the benefit that **the client
    is able to control its load** but also might have the downside of
    **introducing latency** , ie. when there are messages on the queue
    and the client is not handling messages but just waiting for the
    moment to poll for a new message;
-   In a **push scenario** , the queue will push messages to clients as
    soon as a message is received. The advantage here is that there is
    **no latency** , but the **clients can not self-manage their load**
    .

### Pros 

-   Independent tech stack, deployment and scalability of services;
-   Common, simple and reliable communication channel (text through
    HTTP, port 80);
-   Optimised communication;
-   Stable communication specification;
-   Insulation of Domain contexts;
-   **Easy attachment and detachment of services;**
-   **Asynchronous communication helps manage the system's load.**

### Cons 

-   **Difficult integration** of different web services, due to
    different communication languages, ie. two web services that use
    different JSON representations of the same concept;

**Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)** 
--------------------------------

During the 1990s, at the same time that the Web Services were evolving,
the Enterprise Service Bus was already making use of them (maybe some
implementations even used CORBA initially?).

The ESB came to life in a context where the companies had their
stand-alone applications, like one application for finance, another one
for human resources, another one for stock management, etc., and they
needed to make those applications communicate with each other, they
needed to integrate them. But those applications had not been thought
with integration in mind, there was no common language format for
applications to communicate (as there isn't one today). So the
reasonable solution was for the application vendors to create
endpoints to send and receive data in a specific format. The client
companies would then have to integrate the applications by establishing
a communication pipe and translate the messages from one application
language to another.

The Message Queue could contribute to solving this problem, but it still
could not solve the problem of applications having different language
formats. Nevertheless, it was a small step to change the Message Queue
from a dumb communication channel into a middleware that handles both
delivering messages and their transformation into the language/format
expected by the receiver. The ESB was a natural evolution of the simpler
Message Queue.

![esb-2](https://herbertograca.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/esb-2.gif?w=290&h=341)

In this architecture type, we have composite applications, typically
user-facing, that contact web services to perform some operation. This
web services, in turn, can also contact other web services and in the
end, they may return some data back to the composite application.
However, both the composite application and the back-end services have
no knowledge of the details of each other, namely their location or
communication protocols. What they do know is what service they need and
the location of the Service Bus.

So the client application (be it a service or a composite application)
sends its request to the Service Bus, which in turn **transforms** the
message into the format expected by the destination and **routes** the
request to the destination. It's important to note that **all**
communication goes through the ESB, which means that if the ESB goes
down, all communications go down and all systems are rendered
inoperative. In the end, an ESB works like a middleware where a lot of
things happen, rendering it a highly complex artefact.

This was, of course, a very basic explanation of what an ESB
architecture is. Furthermore, although the ESB is the main artefact in
this architecture, there can be other artefacts involved, like Domain
Brokers, Data Services, Process Orchestration Services or Rules Engines.
This same architecture pattern can also be set up in a federated design,
where the system is segregated in business domains, each with its own
ESB setup and all of those setups connected between them. This helps to
improve performance and mitigate the problem of having a single point of
failure, ie. if one ESB fails, only its business domain will be
affected.

![federated\_esb](https://herbertograca.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/federated_esb.jpg?w=1088&h=671)

The primary duties of an ESB are:

-   Monitor and control **routing** of message exchange between
    services;
-   Resolve **translation of messages** between communicating service
    components;
-   Control **deployment** and **versioning** of services;
-   Marshal use of **redundant services** ;
-   Cater for **commodity services** like event handling, data
    transformation and mapping, message and event queuing and
    sequencing, security or exception handling, protocol conversion and
    enforcing proper quality of communication service;

>
> Martin Fowler 2014,
> [Microservices](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html)

This architecture pattern has advantages but I find it especially useful
if we don't " *own* " the web services and therefore need a
**middleware** to translate the messages between them, orchestrate
business processes involving several web services, etc..

It's also good to keep in mind that the ESB implementations have evolved
and today we can even use a simple drag & drop UI to configure an ESB,
for most use cases.

### Pros 

-   Independent tech stack, deployment and scalability of services;
-   Common, simple and reliable communication channel (text through
    HTTP, port 80);
-   Optimised communication;
-   Stable communication specification;
-   Insulation of Domain contexts;
-   Easy attachment and detachment of services;
-   Asynchronous communication helps manage the system's load;
-   **Single point for versioning and translation management.**

### Cons 

-   Slower communication speed, especially for those already compatible
    services;
-   **Centralised logic** :
    -   Single point of failure that can bring down all communications
        in the Enterprise;
    -   High configuration and maintenance complexity;
    -   In time the ESB can end up containing business rules;
    -   Due to its complexity it will eventually need a team just to
        manage it;
    -   Services become highly dependent of the ESB.

**Microservices** 
-----------------

The Microservices Architecture has its foundations on the SOA concepts,
and shares the same global goals as the ESB: Creating one global
enterprise application from several more specific business domain
applications.

The key difference is that the ESB was born into a context of
**stand-alone applications that needed to be integrated** in order to
achieve an enterprise-wide distributed application, while the
Microservices Architecture was born into a context of fast paced and
ever changing **businesses who (mostly) create their own cloud
applications** from scratch.

In other words, the starting point is different. In the case of the ESB,
we start with **existing applications which we do not "own"** , and
therefore we can not change them. But with the Microservices, we have
**full control over the application(s)** (which doesn't mean there can't
be any 3rd party web services involved in the system).

The way microservices are built/designed prevents a high need for
integration. Microservices should be specific to a business concept, to
a bounded context, they should keep their own state so that they don't
depend directly on other microservices and therefore need less
integration. In other words, the low coupling and high cohesion provided
by microservices have the nice side effect of reducing the need for
integration.

> Sam Newman 2015, [Principles Of
> Microservices](https://youtu.be/PFQnNFe27kU?t=1m50s)

Since the biggest drawback of the ESB Architecture was the very complex
and central application of which all other applications would depend on,
the Microservices Architecture addresses that problem by removing it
almost completely.

There are still elements that are cross-cutting to the whole
microservices ecosystem, but they don't contain so many responsibilities
as the ESB would contain. For example, there still is a Message Queue
used for asynchronous communication between microservices, but it is
simply a message pipe with no other responsibilities. Another example is
the microservice ecosystem gateway through which all communications with
the outside are made.

Sam Newman, the author of *[Building
Microservices](https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/Building-Microservices-Sam-Newman/1491950358)*
, identifies 8 principles of a Microservices Architecture:

-   **Services are modelled around business domains\
    ** Because it can give us stable interfaces around a business
    concept, very cohesive and decoupled units of code and clearly
    identified bounded contexts;
-   **Culture of automation\
    ** Because we will have a lot more moving parts and deployable
    units;
-   **Hide implementation details**\
    To allow one service to evolve independently of another;
-   **Decentralise all the things\
    ** Decentralise the decision making power and the architectural
    concepts, giving autonomy to the teams so that the organisation
    transforms itself into a Complex Adaptative System who can quickly
    adapt to change;
-   **Deploy independently\
    ** So that we can deploy a new version of a service without the need
    to change anything else;
-   **Consumer first\
    ** A service should be easy to consume, easy to be used by other
    services;
-   **Isolate** failure\
    So that even if one service fails, the others continue to operate,
    giving the overall system a high resilience to failure;
-   **Highly observable\
    ** Due to the system high number of parts, it is more difficult to
    understand everything that is going on, so we need sophisticated
    monitoring tools that allow us to know what is going on in every
    corner of the system and understand any chain reactions.

### Pros 

-   Independent tech stack, deployment and scalability of services;
-   Common, simple and reliable communication channel (text through
    HTTP, port 80);
-   Optimised communication;
-   Stable communication specification;
-   Insulation of Domain contexts;
-   Easy attachment and detachment of services;
-   Asynchronous communication helps manage the system's load;
-   **Synchronous communication helps manage the system's performance;**
-   **Truly independent and autonomous services;**
-   **No business logic outside of the services;**
-   **Potential to transform the organisation into a *Complex Adaptative
    System* , composed of several small autonomous parts/teams who can
    quickly adapt to business changes.**

### Cons 

-   **High operational complexity** :
    -   Needs high investment in a strong DevOps culture;
    -   Using a multitude of technologies and libraries can get out of
        hand;
    -   Input and output API changes must be managed carefully because
        there will be software relying on those interfaces;
    -   The usage of eventual consistency has significant implications
        that must be addressed while developing the application, all the
        way from the back-end to the UX layers;
    -   Testing becomes more complex as interface changes can have
        unpredictable consequences in other services.

**Anti-Pattern: Ravioli Architecture** 
--------------------------------------

![ravioli](https://herbertograca.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/ravioli.png?w=1100)

*Ravioli Architecture* is the name commonly used to refer to the
**anti-pattern for Microservices Architecture** . It happens when we end
up creating an ecosystem of micro-services where they are too many, too
small and don't represent domain concepts on their own.

**Conclusion** 
--------------

SOA has evolved a lot in the last decades and, derived from both the
insufficiencies of the implemented solutions and the technological
advances, we have reached the Microservices Architecture.

The idea behind this whole evolution has always been the usual strategy
used to solve complex problems: break the problem into smaller, solvable
pieces.

Solving the code complexity can also be done in the same way when we
have a monolith, breaking it up into decoupled domain components
(bounded contexts). But, as the teams and the codebase grows, so does
the need for independent evolution, scalability & deployability. SOA
provides the tools for this independence, forcing stricter boundaries
between bounded contexts.

![soa](https://herbertograca.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/soa.gif?w=1100)

Once more, it's about low coupling and high cohesion, this time at an
even coarser granularity than before. It's also, again, fundamental to
analyse our needs with pragmatism: use SOA only when we really need to,
because it brings a lot of complexity to the mix, and **if we do really
need to use SOA** let's create Microservices in the **size and quantity
that really fit our needs** , no more, no less.
