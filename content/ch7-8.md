# Action-Domain-Responder

MVC was created in 1979, in a context of desktop applications with CLI
user interfaces and it implied that the UI would be changed
automatically if there were changes in the database, caused by some
factor external to the user. The same pattern was perfectly usable later
on desktop applications with a GUI.

However, its usage in web applications has always been an adaptation
because most web applications don't change the UI as a consequence of
changes that happen in the server side, there is always a call from the
UI asking the server side for an update of the screen.

I have talked about [variants of the MVC pattern before](ch07.md),
this chapter is about another variant: **_Action-Domain-Responder_**,
created by Paul M. Jones.

## 2014 -- Action-Domain-Responder

The ADR pattern was created by Paul M. Jones back in 2014 and the idea
is, as RMR, to adjust MVC to the context of web REST APIs. The [original
explanation of
ADR](https://github.com/pmjones/adr#action-domain-responder) is quite
simple and clear, I can't really rephrase it much better, so I will just
copy/paste parts of it here, and add just a few more comments.

![ADR.2](https://herbertograca.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/adr-22.png?w=1100)

### Action

Is the logic to connect the _Domain_ and _Responder_ . It invokes the
_Domain_ with inputs collected from the HTTP request, then invokes the
_Responder_ with the data it needs to build an HTTP response.

You can see an example action
[here](https://github.com/pmjones/adr-example/blob/master/src/Web/Blog/Add/BlogAddAction.php).

### Domain

Is an entry point to the domain logic forming the core of the
application, modifying state and persistence as needed. This may be a
Transaction Script, Service Layer, Application Service, or something
similar.

You can see an example of a domain entry point
[here](https://github.com/pmjones/adr-example/blob/master/src/Domain/Blog/BlogService.php).

### Responder

Is the presentation logic to build an HTTP response from the data it
receives from the _Action_ . It deals with status codes, headers and
cookies, content, formatting and transformation, templates and views,
and so on.

You can see an example responder
[here](https://github.com/pmjones/adr-example/blob/master/src/Web/Blog/Add/BlogAddResponder.php).

### How it works

1.  The web handler receives an HTTP request and dispatches it to an
    Action;
2.  The Action invokes the Domain, collecting any required inputs to the
    Domain from the HTTP request;
3.  The Action then invokes the Responder with the data it needs to
    build an HTTP response (typically the HTTP request and the Domain
    results, if any);
4.  The Responder builds an HTTP response using the data fed to it by
    the Action;
5.  The Action returns the HTTP response to the web handler sends the
    HTTP response.

The HTTP response is built by the Responder by parsing and understanding
the domain response, which in turn depends on the use case of the action
method. This means that each action method needs a specific Responder.
If we would put all of the resource methods in the same controller, we
would need to instantiate and inject all the Responders but we would
only use one in during an HTTP request, which is obviously not optimal.
The solution is then to have only one method in each controller. This
controller and its only action method are what ADR refers to as Action.

Since the Action only has one method, the method name can be something
generic like `run`, `execute`, or in the case of PHP
`__invoke` making the class a callable. However, because the
idea is to adapt the MVC pattern to the context of an HTTP REST API, the
Action (Controller) names are mapped to the HTTP request methods so we
will have Actions with names as `Get`, `Post`,
`Put`, `Delete`, ..., making explicit what
controller is called for each HTTP request type. As an organization
pattern, all Actions on a resource should be grouped under a folder
named after the resource.

### Misconception of ADR

Anthony Ferrara compares ADR to [RMR](ch7-7.md) as
"_[the same pattern with a few details tweaked](https://blog.ircmaxell.com/2014/11/alternatives-to-mvc.html#ADR-Action-Domain-Responder)_".

I disagree. I actually think Anthony Ferrara understood it wrong (he
seems quite smart and knowledgeable, but it happens to all of us):

1.  "_Resource==Domain_"\
    In RMR the _Resource_ is not the Domain, it is a domain object, it
    is a domain entity, while _Domain_ in ADR relates to the whole of
    the domain objects, all the entities and their relations as a whole;
2.  "_Representation==Responder_"\
    In RMR the _Representation_ is the response sent back to the client,
    in ADR a _Responder_ is an object whose responsibility is to create
    the response, given some content and some template.
3.  "_it shares RMRs coupling to HTTP that it becomes difficult to make
    a non-HTTP interface_"\
    Since ADR sees the Domain as a whole and not as an Entity, the
    Action is not inside a domain object, it simply asks the domain
    objects to perform some business logic. So the Domain is not coupled
    to the UI, we can create a CLI command that uses domain objects to
    execute some task.

### My take on this pattern

It seems to me that, at the moment of this writing, **ADR is the best
adaptation of MVC** **for the HTTP request/response paradigm** because
it clearly adapts the **HTTP** requests and responses to the **Domain**
requests and responses while still keeping the Domain completely
decoupled from the presentation layer.

The HTTP requests methods (desired actions on the resource) are
explicitly connected to the code receiving the HTTP request because each
HTTP method maps directly to a controller method name. This has the
added benefit of resulting in clear, explicit and predictable code
organization as opposed to controllers with plenty of actions, often
unrelated, often poorly named and therefore unpredictable, often doing
extremely similar things. In other words, it prevents a muddy spaghetti
of controllers and actions.

Furthermore, it also does a great job at decoupling the code that is
about the interaction itself (invoking the domain) from the code that is
about understanding the interaction result (the domain response) and
translating it to the client.

Nevertheless, there are some points to take into consideration:

1.  This pattern was thought of specifically for REST APIs, so in this
    form **it is not refined enough to be used in web applications with
    an HTML interface** (ie. what would be the name of the action to
    show a form, prior to creating a resource?);
2.  Having only **one method per controller makes this pattern more
    verbose,** because, for example, instead of having one controller
    (class) with 4 actions (public methods) we will have four
    controllers and four actions;
3.  Creating **Responders for each action also adds verbosity** to the
    pattern. If the logic to translate the domain response into an HTTP
    response is simple we should consider if it is worth using a
    Responder. Not using Responders would mean that we would be able to
    have several methods in each controller, each of them still mapping
    to an HTTP method.

**Considering points 2 and 3**, Paul M. Jones [acknowledges them
himself](https://github.com/pmjones/adr/blob/master/TRADEOFFS.md) and
agrees that in some cases it can be acceptable to use a simplification
of the pattern that, although not as elegant, can be enough for the
context at hand.

**Regarding point 1**, I think the pattern can easily be extended so
that it is fully usable with an HTML interface: We can emulate some
extra HTTP methods specifically to handle the HTML requests that a REST
API does not have. For example, in a REST API we can use a
`PUT` or a `POST` to create and/or update a resource
and that is all it is needed, however with an HTML interface we need to
show a form prior to sending a `POST` or `PUT`
request, but there are no HTTP methods that specify that the client
requests a form to create a resource, nor a form to edit a resource.
Nevertheless, we can emulate this by using a `GET` request with
a header of `create` or `edit` which the front
controller can interpret and forward the request to the corresponding
Action named `Create` or `Edit` which would then reply
with the corresponding HTML form. We would need, however, to be very
careful and minimalistic about the extra custom HTTP methods we
create... otherwise it might lead us to a plethora of custom HTTP
methods and a mess of custom HTTP methods tied to actions spaghetti!!
So, **proceed with care regarding this last suggestion of mine**.
