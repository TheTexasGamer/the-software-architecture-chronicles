# The Software Architecture Chronicles

_I write about what I've learned about Software Architecture, how I think of it, and how I use that knowledge._

I am calling these series of chapters "The Software Architecture
Chronicles", not because I think of myself as a great writer but because
I find the name rather corny in a funny way! ðŸ˜€

In this first post, I am going to talk about why I am writing this
series of chapters and what's to come.

## **The importance of knowing our history**

I find it important to learn from history, it can teach us a lot. At a
personal level, we (eventually & hopefully) learn from our personal
mistakes. As a country, history helps model our culture, helps create an
idea of a group, an idea of 'us', a national identity. It also helps us
learn from our ancestor mistakes, like trusting people with very weird
ideas, think WW2 ...

For us, as developers, it helps us build on our predecessor
developers knowledge. It helps us learn from their mistakes, from their
paths, from their experiences: their knowledge. It helps us achieve
higher grounds by " _standing on the shoulders of giants_ "!

In my path to be a better developer, I've read a lot of articles,
watched a lot of conference talks, and read plenty of books. I do my
best to _stand on the shoulders of giants_ !

One thing that puzzles me though, is that there are many opinions based
on opinions based on opinions... And this works like the "Chinese
whispering game", where we end up with a distorted idea of what a paper,
article or book really states.

So I set out to scavenge the internet for the original papers, articles
and books that state the concepts that I find of most importance for my
work, and reason about them by myself.

These chapters are the result of this reasoning, as I try to understand how
these concepts came to be, in a somewhat chronological way.

Writing these chapters forced me to read and reason a lot about all these
subjects and helped me understand the techniques used today in software
development and I hope these chapters are helpful to more fellow
developers.

Nevertheless, if you read something you don't understand or disagree
with, please let me know, I am perfectly open to discussing these
subjects, learn from other people and change my point of view when I'm
proven wrong.

## **Timeline**

This is a rough timeline of software development evolution, as I
perceive it after having read articles and books about all these
subjects. I added links to where I found the date reference, and I put a
"\~" wherever I'm not very sure of the date, meaning "approximately". We
can also find a plethora of information about these things through the
main [Programming Paradigm page in
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm).

I will talk about most of these subjects in this series of
posts.
