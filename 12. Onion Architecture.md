*This post is part of [The Software Architecture
Chronicles](https://herbertograca.com/2017/07/03/the-software-architecture-chronicles/)
, a [series of posts about Software
Architecture](https://herbertograca.com/category/development/series/software-architecture/)
. In them, I write about what I've learned on Software Architecture, how
I think of it, and how I use that knowledge. The contents of this post
might make more sense if you read the previous posts in this series.*

The [Onion Architecture was coined by Jeffrey Palermo in
2008](http://jeffreypalermo.com/blog/the-onion-architecture-part-1/) .
As I see it, it builds on the Ports & Adapters Architecture by adhering
to the idea of placing the domain in the centre of the application,
externalising the delivery mechanisms (UI) and infrastructure used by
the system (ORM, Search engines, 3rd party APIs, ...). But it goes
further and adds internal layers to it.

[ ]{#more-8818} We went from the Layered Architecture, with usually 4
layers (Presentation, Application, Domain, Persistence), to the Ports &
Adapters Architecture which only implicitly mentions two concentric
layers:

1.  An external layer representing the delivery mechanisms and
    infrastructure;
2.  An internal layer representing the business logic.

Both Ports & Adapters and Onion Architecture share the idea of isolating
the application core from the infrastructure concerns by writing adapter
code so that the infrastructure code does not leak into the application
core. This makes it easier to replace both the tools and the delivery
mechanisms used by the application, providing some protection against
technology, tooling and vendor lockdown.

It also gives the application the pleasant ability to be able to run
without the need for real infrastructure nor delivery mechanisms as they
can be swapped by mocks, which is great for testing.

However, the Onion Architecture also tells us that, in enterprise
applications, we will have more than those two layers, and it adds some
layers in the business logic which we might recognise from Domain Driven
Design:

Furthermore, it makes explicit the implicit idea of Ports & Adapters
Architecture about the direction of dependencies:

-   Outer layers depend on inner layers;
-   Inner layers do not know about outer layers.

This means that the direction of coupling is towards the centre,
providing us with an independent object model (domain model), who in its
core depends on nothing. We have the flexibility of being able to change
the outer layers without impacting the inner, and more important,
layers. It makes use of the Dependency Inversion Principle, at an
architectural level.

> Key tenets of Onion Architecture:
>
> -   The application is built around an independent object model
> -   Inner layers define interfaces. Outer layers implement interfaces
> -   Direction of coupling is toward the center
> -   All application core code can be compiled and run separate from
>     infrastructure
>

Also, any outer layer can directly call any inner layer, which does not
break the coupling direction and avoids creating proxy methods and even
proxy classes that contain no business logic, just for the sake of
complying with some layering scheme. This also comes in line with the
preferences expressed by Martin Fowler.

### **Conclusion** {#conclusion style="text-align:justify;"}

Onion Architecture builds on the Ports & Adapters Architecture to add
some internal organisation to the business logic of the application
based on a few Domain Driven Design concepts.

Again, this is an evolution in further segregating responsibilities,
providing for low coupling and high cohesion, which in turn provides for
more testability and maintainability.
